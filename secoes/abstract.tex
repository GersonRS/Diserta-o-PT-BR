Gravitational wave astronomy has set in motion a scientific revolution. To further increase the scientific reach of this emerging field, there is a pressing need to increase the depth and speed of gravitational wave algorithms that have allowed these breakthrough discoveries. To contribute to this effort, we intend to create a new highly scalable method for processing end-to-end time series signals based on a neural network system for signal classification in highly noisy time series data flows. Demonstrating a new training scheme with gradually increasing noise levels. Validate the application of this method for the detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole fusions. And this method is expected to significantly outperform conventional machine learning techniques, achieving similar performance compared to combined filtering, which is several times faster, allowing real-time processing of large volumes of raw data with minimal features. More importantly, the proposed method extends the range of gravitational wave signals that can be detected with terrestrial gravitational wave detectors. This framework leverages recent advances in artificial intelligence algorithms and emerging hardware architectures such as machine-optimized GPUs to facilitate real-time searches of gravitational wave sources and their astro-particle and electromagnetic counterparts.

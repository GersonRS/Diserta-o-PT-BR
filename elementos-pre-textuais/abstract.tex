Gravitational wave astronomy set in motion a scientific revolution. To further increase the scientific reach of this emerging field, there is an urgent need to increase the depth and decrease the computational complexity of gravitational wave algorithms. Machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks, are already being used in gravitational wave astrophysics to detect and characterize gravitational wave signals. To contribute to this effort, this study shows a new methodology for detecting gravitational waves, using Score Analysis. A neural network committee was developed to detect gravitational waves in real time. Using the Scores created by a committee of neural networks applied to data from the Hanford laboratory and the Livingston laboratory, to classify a signal with gravitational waves and noise. Producing Scores over time and observing new information in this signal, a plateau, in the phase of reverberation of the gravitational wave.

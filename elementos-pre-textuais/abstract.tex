Gravitational wave astronomy set in motion a scientific revolution. To further increase the scientific reach of this emerging field, there is an urgent need to increase the depth and speed of the gravitational wave algorithms that have enabled these innovative discoveries. Machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks, are already transforming many technological fields and have also proven to be successful in gravitational wave astrophysics for detecting and characterizing gravitational wave signals from binary black holes and neutron stars. To contribute to this effort, a new highly scalable and computationally lightweight method for processing time series signals was created, based on a neural network committee system, to quickly classify black hole fusion gravitational wave signals in data streams. of highly noisy time series of data typical of aLIGO's gravitational wave detectors. The results demonstrate the potential of artificial neural networks for the real-time detection of gravitational wave signals, which is essential for immediate monitoring to facilitate real-time searches for gravitational wave sources and their electromagnetic counterparts that accompany these important events.
